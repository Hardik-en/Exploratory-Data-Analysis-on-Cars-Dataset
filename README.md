# 🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis on Cars Dataset

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cars dataset. The goal is to understand the underlying structure, patterns, and relationships within the data through a series of visualizations and statistical summaries.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Identify missing values and handle them appropriately
- Explore data distributions and summary statistics
- Discover correlations between key variables
- Visualize trends using various plots (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.)
- Generate insights that could inform business or research decisions

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes of cars such as:

- Make and model
- Engine specifications
- Fuel type
- Transmission
- Mileage
- Price
- Year of manufacture

*Note: Make sure to include or reference the source of the dataset if it's publicly available.*

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- Correlation Heatmap to show relationships between numerical features
- Distribution plots to analyze individual attributes
- Scatter plots to explore pairwise relationships

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Identify which features most influence car prices
- Detect multicollinearity among variables
- Understand how factors like mileage and engine size affect resale value
